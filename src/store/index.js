		experience: `<p>I started as a Sales and Marketing Assistant in the Indophil Group of Companies, the largest Yarns manufacturer in the Philippines from July 1996 until October 1998.  I then worked as a Sales Officer at Yarn Plus Inc., one of the Top Yarn Traders in the Philippines (from September 1999 until June 2006).  I then tried my luck in the UAE where I started as a Customer Service Supervisor at BSH Walls and Floors in January 2007 until March 2013.  I wanted to pursue outdoor Sales so I tried working as an Export Manager at Casa Walls and Floors (April 2013 to August 2014) handling the Qatar market.  After a year, my earlier boss at BSH Walls and Floors wanted me to come back to handle the Qatar and Oman markets as Country Manager from September  2014 until September 2018.  Then the Qatar and UAE blockade happened in 2017, We tried traveling via Oman for a year, but it has been quite a challenge with the increasing number of hours traveling via Oman (it was just a 45-minute direct flight from Dubai to Qatar, now I have to spend 4-6 hours one way, not to mention the cost of the flights).  After a year, the management decided for me to handle the UAE Hospitality market as a Business Development Manager  (June 2019 - May 2021).  Then the pandemic happened and with travel restrictions and lockdowns in most countries started,  international tourist arrivals declined by 22% in UAE resulting in an estimated loss of US$80bn in global tourism receipts.  Since my main market was Hospitality, my clients were directly hit by the pandemic, resulting in hotel closures for some periods of time.  I decided to lay low and focus on taking care of my kids at home, and later on, we decided to come back here to the Philippines.</p>`,
